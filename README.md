# p2p
This is an attrmpt to make a p2p project. 

What is p2p
me and you are equal both share a book but once the book is shared we both have it. Call it smart redundancy or call it deoptimised space management.

Scope:-
scope of this project to build a p2p app with a partical simulated GUI where partical's are active p, p as in peers what did you think? 

Introduction:-
it took them 1980 to 2000 to widespread p2p 20 years for the tech to refine, it is currently being used everywhere under you nasus.
there are two types of p2p networks 
1)Unstructured P2P (yayyy)
2)Structured P2P (booo)
3)Hybrid P2P (who is this guy?)

we will be focusing on yayyy from now on because Unstructured p2p is something out of scope for me atm.
